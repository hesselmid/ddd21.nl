  "intro": "Lola van Praag (1992) is a textile developer, artist and fashion designer. She is inspired by different crafting techniques and works with appliqué, embroidery, digital printing, silkscreen printing and industrial knitting techniques in order to create intricate textile pieces. She is very curious about different craft techniques and how these can be applied in a contemporary way. An example is her latest collaboration with the Textile Museum where she experimented with the use of multiple yarn types within the production of a single piece. Using this experiment to see what the limits are of these industrial machines and whenever there is a problem, find solutions by hacking the systems by hand. Because of her unconventional methods in which the manual and mechanical meet, surprising results are achieved. The circular knitting is one of Lola’s favorite techniques but being the curious person she is, we can soon expect her to get her hands on other industrial machines as well.",
