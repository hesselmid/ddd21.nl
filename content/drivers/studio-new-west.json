  "intro": "Studio New West was founded by the two filmmakers Edward van Dongen and Jack Westerlaken. They tell stories through their favourite medium: film. Their work varies from documentaries to corporate stories. Cultural or commercial, but always told from a human perspective.",
  "content_1": "<p>Telling a story starts for studio New West by being curious and asking the right questions. During DDW21 they showcase with the video installation ‘About a story’ their archive in combination with interviews about people's stories. This subconsciously results in an experience where the questions are turned, which reveals the identity of the studio.</p>",
  "content_2": "<p>Studio New West is always looking for new stories. Everyone has an interesting story to tell, but not always the tools and skills to tell it the right way. How do you make sure that your story will be remembered? What story needs to be told according to you? Share your ideas with Studio New West.</p>",
