  "intro": "Telling a story starts for studio New West by being curious and asking the right questions. Studio New West was founded by the two filmmakers Edward van Dongen and Jack Westerlaken. They tell stories through their favourite medium: film. Their work varies from documentaries to corporate stories. Cultural or commercial, but always told from a human perspective.",
  "content_1": "<p>During DDW21 they showcase the audiovisual installation 'About the story'. Interviewing the inspiring stories of their clients is the lense in which they want to show their own design practice. Exposing a common connection based upon curiosity and deep listening. This results in an experience where the roles are turned.</p>",
  "content_2": "<p>Studio New West is always looking for new stories. Everyone has an interesting story to tell, but not always the tools and skills to tell it the right way. How do you make sure that your story will be remembered? Share your ideas with Studio New West.</p>",
