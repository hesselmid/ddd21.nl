  "content_1": "<p>A new product starts with a thought. An idea that either builds on an existing item or an idea that has no form yet. </p> <p>Being able to shape a thought, an idea and materialize it into reality is one of the strong points of Studio Brundal.</p>",
  "content_2": "<p>The work they show at the DDW depicts this process. An object that creates a 3d illusion by means of printed transparent foil layers. An image that adapts to the viewer's position. Which symbolizes the individuality of a brand or customer.</p>",
